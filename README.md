The above code is a simple password generation application. We are using the Tkinter library to create a simple GUI. In this application, the user is given an input box where they must enter the desired number of characters. After entering the number of characters, the user must click on the "Generate" button. When the user clicks the "Generate" button, a password will be displayed using multiple characters, including uppercase and lowercase alphabets, numbers, and symbols. If the user enters "0" in the input box, an alert will be displayed stating, "Length must be greater than 0." If the user does not enter anything and clicks the "Generate" button, another alert will be displayed stating, "Invalid input! Please enter a number."
